/**
 * The IntoMind instrument client, for a browser and for Node.
 *
 * The protocol, the session, and the timebase do no input and no output.
 * They are handed bytes that arrived and they hand back bytes to send,
 * which means they work over whatever Bluetooth stack you already have and
 * can be tested without one. `web-bluetooth.ts` is the browser transport,
 * and it is the only file in this package that touches a radio.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { requestAndConnect } from "@intomind/sdk";
 *
 * const device = await requestAndConnect({
 *   onEvent(event) {
 *     if (event.type === "samples") write(event.batch);
 *     // Written down, never smoothed over.
 *     if (event.type === "gap") writeGap(event.gap);
 *   },
 * });
 * await device.send(device.session.startStream());
 * ```
 *
 * What a device can do is what the device says it can do. Nothing here
 * holds a table of hardware, and a capability is a bit the device reports
 * rather than a version number this package compares against.
